# webpack-config
assignment 3, webpack

## usage
1.
`npm i` - install all dependencies
2.
-`npm i build` build in production mode

-`npm i build:dev` build in development mode

-`npm i start:prod` serve in production mode

-`npm i start` serve in development mode

probably in your console command that include `:` like `npm i start:dev` will throw an error

you just need to use `npm i "start:dev"` instead
